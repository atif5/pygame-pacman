# pygame-pacman
 A pacman clone made with pygame! (incomplete)
  
# How to install and play  
 This project is still being developed, but you are free to play it at your own risk :)
 
 I have provided a batch script for windows users to install and play the game for windows. It assumes that you have git installed.
 Only thing you need to is the run the batch file by double clicking on it, complete setting up python3 and then running `play.bat` after it's generated.
 
 If the installation somehow fails or you are not a windows user, here is the manual installation process.
 
# Installation
You need a python 3 interpreter to play this pacman clone.

To install python3 follow thes guidelines for: [Windows](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/win), [Linux](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux), [MacOs](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx)

  
This project uses two external libraries, [pygame](https://www.pygame.org) and [numpy](https://numpy.org/).

After installing python, you should install these libraries via pip:

For windows:

```$ py -m pip install pygame numpy```

For linux or MacOs:

```$ python3 -m pip install pygame numpy```

After those libraries are installed:

```$ cd pacman```

And then;

For windows:

```$ py -m pacman```

For linux or MacOs:

```$ python3 -m pacman```

Enjoy!
